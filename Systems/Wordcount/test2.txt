	Anthony Weston's Self-Validating Reduction establishes an idea similar to that of a self-
fulfilling prophecy. He lists common examples, such as how predictions that a stock will go up 
can lead to more buyers, thus creating the rise that was predicted. He claims that a similar effect 
happens in ethics, in interactions between humans with other humans, animals, and the land. He 
first describes how this occurs between humans. He argues that having prejudiced thoughts about 
others can lead you to create a biased situation, causing you to see exactly the traits that you 
previously anticipated, reinforcing your original prejudiced thoughts. He claims that someone 
like this would never notice that they are affecting the outcome because they would never 
question their own thoughts. Weston emphasizes that this is different than merely being blind to 
certain issues. He says, for example, that women are changed by misogyny. They become 
alienated and in general, women in the world exemplify the beliefs of the misogynist. He claims 
the same force important in the lasting effects of slavery. Weston argues that this is a powerful 
cycle; he calls the prejudice disvaluation and the effect on the real-world devaluation. He says 
that these perpetuate each other. He makes the connection to a positive feedback loop. He claims 
that disvaluation and devaluation form something similar to a positive feedback loop, where the 
effects of each are constantly amplified by the system. To continue the metaphor, he points out 
there comes a point where positive feedback loops become difficult or impossible to stop. In the 
same way, the scenarios in which prejudices perpetuate themselves become difficult to reverse.
	Afterwards, Weston goes on to describe how the same disvaluation-devaluation cycle 
applies to how we treat animals. First, he points toward factory farms that produce the chickens 
and pigs we eat constantly. He looks at their poor living conditions and cites the fact that we 
think of them simply as food, as the cause. We treat them not like we would one another; to us, 
animals are "just animals". Then, as we observe them in these farms, we look at their behaviors 
and make note of how stupid they are, without any respect to the fact that we subject them to the 
conditions that made them this way. As a result, people have no problem treating these animals 
solely as resources. In the meantime, attempts made by people to treat them with respect are seen 
as foolish or sentimental.
	Next, Weston goes on to describe how humans treat the land; the Earth, in the same 
negative, self-perpetuating way. He cites historical examples of drastic changes to the 
environment caused by humans, such as the Greeks cutting down the trees on Mount Parnassus 
for their navies. He claims that the world's health was already diminishing, and that it's been 
acknowledged but also sped up. He says this anthropocentric view, this view that humans are the 
most significant species, leads to great damages to the land that we don't even give a second 
thought about. He lists examples of increasing human efficiency at the cost of ecological 
deterioration and the reduction of land to eye-pleasing "scenery".
	In the next section, Weston claims that this anthropocentric view inevitably leads to the 
gradual disappearance of all other views. For example, we have begun to see animals in general 
as either resources or tools for our pleasure. It will become harder and harder to see them any 
other way if things remain unchanged. Plots of land could eventually be seen only to be useful 
for more malls and suburbs. Treating things one way helps us along the way to treating all things 
like it in the same way. Weston, for example, claims that no land is safe, that any untouched land 
is only untouched so far.
	In Henry David Thoreau's Walden, he describes his experience living a simple life in a 
house he built himself for a couple years. He has us question what we believe the "right" way to 
live is. There is the notion that much of what we do day to day is superfluous, unnecessary to 
live a happy life. I think that living the kind of life Thoreau describes in Walden goes hand-in-
hand with living a life less clouded by anthropocentrism as Weston desires. Thoreau avoids the 
life driven by material possessions, which I would consider to be one of the predominant forces 
behind anthropocentrism. "By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, [men] are employed, 
as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break 
through and steal. It is a fool's life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not 
before..." (Thoreau 2). In today's society, there's always a need for more, more money, more 
entertainment, more gadgets. This is one of the major forces behind the human being's tendency 
to treat the animals and land around them as nothing but resources. I think that Weston would 
appreciate the societal shift associated with living like Thoreau in Walden. While the goals are 
different, the society produced by that sort of living is favorable to both.
	In Miriam Greenspan's Healing through the Dark Emotions, she describes how humans 
often attempt to hide their "dark" emotions, the ones they would rather not feel. They look for 
ways to set aside that emotional pain, rather than live it out. I think this observation on human 
nature helps expand on Weston's position. One of Weston's major concerns with the whole 
disvaluation-devaluation cycle is the fact that, like a positive feedback loop, it is extremely 
difficult to stop or reverse once put into motion. Greenspan's description of human nature helps 
to illustrate in part why this is. For most of the examples Weston cites, humans generally have 
some knowledge of what's going on. I'm sure many of us realize that the meat we eat comes 
from animals living in poor conditions. However, as Greenspan suggests, the typical person 
would rather turn a blind eye than engage these unpleasant thoughts. Almost everyone would 
rather just enjoy their chicken and be done with it. As a result, I think Greenspan and Weston 
share a common goal here; for a better world, people should be willing to confront their "dark" 
emotions, these thoughts they would set aside. For Weston, this could lead to more people who 
are willing to challenge the anthropocentric view.
	Lastly, in Jim Nollman's The Man Who Talks to Whales, he emphasizes the importance 
of humans treating animals with respect. He thinks this is essential for all species to thrive. "In 
fact, when we forget that we are interdependent with any (or all) other species, those other 
species suffer. We suffer as well." (Nollman 52). Nollman and Weston share a similar desire for 
humans to treat animals with respect, with the hope that all can live better. Both share the belief 
that if our current behavior go unchecked, changes will be made that we can't reverse. Nollman 
has pointed out the way certain animals have become very wary of humans. It will take a long 
time to restore any kind of trust. Meanwhile, Weston thinks that if we keep going down this path 
it'll become harder and harder to think of other animals as anything more than food, resources, 
and entertainment. There's a sense of urgency emerging from both pieces.
