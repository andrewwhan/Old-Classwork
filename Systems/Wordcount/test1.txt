1.	What do Marx and Nietzsche say about religion? Are they correct? Refer to biblical 
passages in support of your answer.
Marx and Nietzsche say that religion is a product of human suffering. In Marx's Critique of 
Hegel's Philosophy of Right, he talks about how religion is created by man as a reflection of 
current society. He believes that man is suffering and created religion as a coping mechanism. 
Nietzsche expands on this, describing a scenario where the oppressed put together a religion 
piece by piece. They take their pain and suffering and hide it behind the veil of religion. He 
shows it as a lie that becomes crafted out of weakness. Weaknesses like powerlessness to 
retaliate and submission before others become warped into ideal traits such as goodness and 
obedience. Nietzsche claims that they are miserable, and so turn to God for comfort. They ease 
themselves by claiming that it's merely a trial set forth by God, and that they will end up 
triumphant if they remain faithful. Nietzsche says that these people, full of vengeance and hatred, 
turn these emotions into eager anticipation for the day when God and righteousness reign. I 
believe that Marx and Nietzsche are correct in their assessment of religion. Isaiah 58 is a strong 
example of a portion of a bible that discourages the actions of oppressors. It serves to give the 
oppressed relief knowing that the word of God says that what oppressors do is wrong. They are 
wrong to punish their servants, to start fights. The passage emphasizes helping those in need; 
sharing food with the hungry, clothing the poor. These are exactly the words that the oppressed 
want to hear as they strive for some sort of equality. The rules outlined in Leviticus 19 serve the 
same purpose. God doesn't want you to cheat your workers. God wants you to help the stranger, 
the poor. All should be treated equally on trial. Meanwhile, all the rituals create another sense of 
equality in the fact that no one is exempt from such acts. All followers of God are equal and must 
follow the same rules. All these words serve to comfort the suffering human, who wishes only to 
be on equal ground with his oppressors.

2.	Consider the arguments we looked at from Hume's Dialogues. Restate as simply and 
clearly as possible the three positions and criticize them.
   The first argument for God's existence in Hume's Dialogues is the claim that God is self-
evident, that he requires no further proof or explanation. It is suggested that it is impossible for 
us to comprehend God because we are limited as creatures. We can conceptualize "nothing more 
perfect than a human mind", states one of the characters in Dialogues. As a result, it is 
impossible for us to draw any significant conclusions about the nature of God. The problem with 
this argument is that it is lacking in religious significance. For a religion to make a meaningful 
impact on a person's life, two factors are necessary: the God has to care about what you do, and 
there must be some form of meaningful communication with the God. If all we can say about the 
existence of God is that he is self-evident, then we have no knowledge of God's motives, and 
whether he cares about what we do. In that case, one could say that he exists, but it would not be 
religiously significant in any way. The other problem with this argument is that there's no way to 
demonstrate such an existence. There no such evidence that could possibly lead to this 
conclusion. This argument is made without any actual premise to support it.
	The second argument for God's existence is structured as follows: Everything that exists 
has a cause. The universe exists. Therefore, the universe has a cause (God). There are several 
issues with this argument. For example, one could argue: if God exists, then who, or what, 
caused God? Another issue is that it also suffers from failing to be religiously significant. This 
argument merely implies there was a cause of the universe. After the universe was created, the 
cause (God) could have just completely ignored any further developments. This argument does 
nothing to imply that God in any way cares about his creation. In addition, it fails to be 
religiously significant because this cause was not necessarily the God as described in the bible. It 
could have been any of the other creators described in the hundreds of other religions around the 
world. For that matter, our universe's cause by this argument could just as well have been the big 
bang. The other issue arises with the use of the word "cause". In the premise "everything has a 
cause", we refer to cause as the immediate effect that led to the creation of something. 
Meanwhile, in the conclusion "the universe has a cause", our use of cause refers to the one that 
set into motion the immediate effect. Due to the fact that we change the meaning of the word 
cause between the premise and the conclusion, the argument is invalid.
	The third argument for God's existence begins with the premise that all machines have a 
designer. The world is filled with components that work together so well they resemble human 
made machines. By analogy, the conclusion is that there must exist some creator who is as many 
times greater than man as the world is to a man-made machine. The problem with this argument 
is the use of the word machine. There are a couple ways to describe a machine. One is that a 
machine is a collection of parts which produces an output. Another type of machine would be a 
collection of parts which produces an output, but is also designed with a purpose. Man-made 
machines are of the second type, we create tools to do something, perhaps to make lives easier. 
Meanwhile, the machine described in the conclusion (the universe) seems to follow the first 
definition: it consists of parts that work together and they do indeed produce results, but we can't 
say anything about the purpose of the universe, if it exists at all. Due to the fact that we are 
talking about two different types of machines between the premise and the conclusion, the 
argument becomes invalid. Furthermore, a machine without a purpose more suggests a random 
creator like the big bang rather than a designer.
